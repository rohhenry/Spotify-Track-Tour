About:
This app takes your preferences and helps you create new playlists with a custom machine learning model.

The goal is to introduce you to new, diverse, songs in an interactive way.

Unlike traditional recommendation algorithms which relies heavily on collaborative filtering, this algorithm is purely content based and all the models parameters are displayed.

You will need a spotify premium account to use.

For better performance clone this repo and run this app locally, you will need the relevant api keys though.
